Adapted from [favgen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/favgen) to include more flexibility on the web manifest file

This is a simple CLI tool to generate an optimized set of favicons and a web manifest from a single input file and a web-config file. Icons are optimized in terms of both size and quantity (nowadays you don't need that many of them). They are produced according to [this article](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) which served as an inspiration for the tool.

Use it like this: `npx favgen /path/to/input /path/to/web-config.json -o /path/to/output`.

WebConfig type is found in [src/types.ts](src/types.ts#L1-16)

You can tweak the following settings by giving additional commands:

- output directory by providing `-o` option with a path (`static` by default)
- icon prefix by providing `--prefix` option with a name (`favicon` by default)
- colors palette size by providing `--colors` with a number between 2 and 256 (64 by default)
- producing 16x16 .ico file by setting `--include16` flag

Input file can be in any of the following formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, AVIF, TIFF or SVG (anything [sharp library](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) accepts).

By default, the following set of favicons is produced:

- `favicon.svg` if input file was SVG and `favicon.png` 32x32 otherwise
- `favicon.ico` 32x32
- `favicon-192.png` 192x192 (for Android devices)
- `favicon-512.png` 192x192 (for Android devices)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` 180x180 (original image is resized to 140x140 and 20px transparent padding is added on each side; rationale for this is given in the article)

Additionally, a sample `manifest.webmanifest` file is produced which shows how favicons for Android devices are supposed to be included.

Besides that, PNG output is optimized by `sharp` (which uses `pngquant`) and SVG output is optimized by [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo).
Also, color palette is reduced to 64 colors by default in order to reduce assetsâ€™ size.

The tool can be also used as API:

```js
const { produceIconsAndManifest } = require('pwag');
const inputFilePath = 'favicon.svg';
const outputDirPath = 'static';
const subpath = 'pwa';
const prefix = 'favicon'; // default value
const paletteSize = 64; // default value
const include16 = true; // default is false
produceIconsAndManifest(
	{
		outputDirPath: outputDirPath,
		subpath,
		iconFileName: prefix,
		inputFilePath,
		paletteSize,
		include16,
	},
	{}
);
```
